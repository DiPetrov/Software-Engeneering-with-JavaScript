    1. Bring the crystal closer to the desired thickness.

                       < Instructions >
    2. Complete the process with the least amount of operations.
    3. Each operation takes the same amount of time but the crystal must be transported - takes additional time.
    4. When a consecutive operation differs from the previous one, the crystal must be washed!
    5. Always start with the operation removing the largest amount of material.
    6. Process each chunk and print to the console the order of operations and the number of times they need to be
       repeated to bring them to the desired thickness.

                       < Input >
    7. First number in the array - desired final thickness of the crystal.
    8. All the following numbers represent the thickness of different chunks of quartz ore in microns.

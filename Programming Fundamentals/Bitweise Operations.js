/* Bit - the smallest unit of data used in computing, takes only one of two values: either a 0 or 1, nothing else. Bits are organized in computer memory in sequence of 8 bits, called Bytes. It can only take following simple values:
- on / off
- booleans: true / false
- + / -   

! Zero normally refers to a positive number and 1 refers to a negative number */

/* Byte - the smallest unit of data used who can stand alone - it consists of 8 Bits. 

- KB (kilobyte) == 1024 bytes (sometimes 1000 bytes)
- MB (megabyte) == 1024 KB == 1048576 bytes
- GB (gigabyte) == 1024 MB == 1073741824 bytes
- TB (terabyte) == 1024 GB == 1099511627776 bytes
- PB (petabyte) == 1024 PT == 1125899906842624 bytes */

/* Numerical Systems - system of representing numbers in written form using sequence of digits */

/* Computers use the floating-point number format, defined by the IEEE 754 technical standard - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754

The IEEE-754 standard defines:
- Arithmetic and exchange formats - representations of the binary and decimal floating-point data
- Rounding rules for floating-point numbers
- Operations - arithmetic and other operations
- Special numbers - such as infinity and NaN 
- Floating point numbers are stored as sequence of bits: sign bits, exponent, mantissa. */

/* Computers represent text characters - letters, digits, punctuation etc. as unsigned integer numbers (as sequence of bits).

The ASCII standard https://www.ascii-code.com/ represents chars as 8-but integers (total of 128 Symbols*/

/* All the symbol that are not contained by the ASCII table are contained by the Unicode standard as a 16-bit integers: https://home.unicode.org/ 

The Unicode standard represents over 100 000 text characters and supports many alphabets, e.g. Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic. */

/* Bitwise Operations - NOT(~), AND(&), OR(|), XOR(^) - изключващо или
   - Bitwise operators works with the binary representations of the number, applying bit by bit calculations
   - The operator ~ turns all 0 to 1 and all 1 to 0 (like ! for boolean  expressions but bit by bit).
 ! Networking protocols - Many devices communicate using bit-level protocols
